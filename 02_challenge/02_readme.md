fizzbuzz() takes exactly 1 argument(0 given):

this states that the function fizzbuzz expects 1 argument from the function call

therefore passing an argument in the function call solves the error

the question was for all integers between 1 and 99

thus saving 99 into a variable and passing that as an argument soves the error
