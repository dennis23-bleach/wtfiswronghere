3 ways to solve this error

1. instead of creating a class object, directly calling the class method

	i.e -> Fizz_Buzz.fizzbuzz(100)

2. when declaring the class object declaring it as fizzbuzz_obj = Fizz_Buzz(), makes it take 1 argument

	i.e -> passing it as fizzbuzz_obj = Fizz_Buzz solves this error

3. adding a self argument in the fizzbuzz function also solves the error
