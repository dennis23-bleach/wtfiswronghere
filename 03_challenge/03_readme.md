the user passes 16 as a string to the function fizzbuzz

in the function fizzbuzz, python tries to find the range between 1 and str(16)

since we cannot find range between a num and a string, we can pass 16 as an int itself rather than a string

therefore instead of fizzbuzz('16'), we can pass it as fizzbuzz(16)
